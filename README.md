# NMAP-Access-Parser
A tool that parses nmap output to create files that may be interesting for further testing, or simply for documentation purposes.

-o | output filename. Defaults to "live_hsots.txt" if the flag is not used.  
-f | Subnet file. Give the tool a list of subnets and allow it to output which subnets you are able to reach based on the nmap output.
